# DIY Grid Framework

This is a clone of a lesson page from The Odin Project, a web development learning resource.

This page applies a responsive grid framework I have made, which is similar to the Bootstrap grid layout.  My framework uses the actual CSS grid, which has some tradeoffs compared to the flexbox approach Bootstrap uses.

Both the framework and the other site styles take advantage of Sass preprocessing.
